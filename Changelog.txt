version 1.1.0

completed-

- This code is for interfacing D6T-44L motion sensor with Microchip PIC16-32 dev board having PIC24FJ1024Gb610 controller using I2C protocol.
- In this, I2C level shifter is used as sensor works on 5V.
- Tested data received on UART Tera Term terminal.

To be done-
- Change the controller to PIC24FJ128GA606.
- Implement the logic to send the collected sensor data to GUI using MODBUS protocol.


Version 1.0.0

Completed- 

- Implemented a code for testing the PIR Motion sensor using PIC24FJ128GA606 controller.
- Tested when it detects IR/IV light, LED turned ON and digital data received on controller pin.
- Collected Data sends through MODBUS protocol to Planetary Subunit(GUI).
